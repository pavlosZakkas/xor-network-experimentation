## XOR network

A simple neural network was implemented from scratch in order to solve the XOR problem and evaluate the impact of different parameters on the performance of the model.

The experimentation was focused on the following parameters:


- **activation functions**: 
    - sigmoid
    - tanh
    - ReLu
    - Leaky ReLu
    - ELu


- **weights initialization**:
    - normal distributed
    - uniformly distributed
    - xavier uniform and normal initialization
    - he initialization


- **learning rate**
